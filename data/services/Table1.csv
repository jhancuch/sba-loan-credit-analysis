"[Estimates are based on data from the 2020 Service Annual Survey and administrative data. Dollar volume estimates are published in millions of dollars, unit estimates are published in thousands of units; consequently, results may not be additive.  Estimates have been adjusted using results of the 2017 Economic Census where applicable. In some instances, results from the 2017 Economic Census may reflect revisions based on additional analytical review following the release of the 2017 Geographic Area Statistics. For a description of benchmarking methods and exceptions, see http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sas/technical-documentation/methodology/benchmarkprocess.html] ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
